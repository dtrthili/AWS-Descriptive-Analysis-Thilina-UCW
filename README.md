**Project Description:**

Descriptive Data Analysis on Council Voting Report - City of Vancouver


**Project Title:**

Voting patterns of the Council Members: A Exploratory Data Analysis


**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to perform descriptive data analysis on the Council Vote dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to member voting. By summarizing the data such as voting year, vote, members, we aim to understand how it will illustrating the participation of these Canadian Municipalities in making decisions.


**Dataset:**

The Council Vote dataset consists of information such as:

• Vote-Detail-Id: Unique identifier for each vote

• Vote-Date: Date of the vote

• Council-Member: Name of the council member

• Vote: Categories of the vote (In Favour / In Opposition / Absent / Abstained) 


**Methodology:**

**1- Data Collection and Preparation:**

o Download the Council Vote report from the City of Vancouver - Open Data Portal

https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/export/?disjunctive.meeting_type&disjunctive.vote_number&disjunctive.council_member&disjunctive.vote&q.timerange.vote_date=vote_date:%5B2024-07-01+TO+2024-07-31%5D

o Design the process by using draw.io.

I used the S3 bucket to store my dataset. By using AWS Glue Data Brew, I created a project and clean my data (without null values/correct data formats, etc.). The clean data again will be stored in the S3 bucket in a different folder. By using AWS Glue, I created a pipeline to generate appropriate data and save it in a different folder in the S3 bucket.


**2- Data Ingestion:**

I have used an S3 bucket for my data file. I used Standard storage since I needed to access the data regularly. Bucket bc-vote-raw will have a folder (Council-Vote), and I used some other folders to identify the data source clearly (Ingestion_Year=2024 and Ingestion_Month=July).


**3- Data Profiling:**

I have used AWS Glue Data Brew for Data Profiling. By creating a project called 'bc-vote-council-project,' I have created another bucket for the transform data. In that bucket, I have another folder for the Data Profiling output.

Profile Output:

**4- Data Cleaning:**

Instead, to clean this data, I have made a new folder than the profiling one. In this folder, there are System and User folders. The output will go respectively according to decision. Also, I have saved the recipe for future reference as well.

**5- Data Pipeline Design:**

I used an SQL query filter to filter the ‘In Favour’ records. The output for this pipeline saved the records in respective places under the Council Vote folder → In the Favour Vote folder in the S3 bucket.

**Conclusion:**

o Generated reliabile outputs for calculating the number of each votes (vote categories).

o Tools and Technologies:

• AWS - Amazon S3 / AWS Data Glue / Amazon Athena

This project not only demonstrates my analytical and programming skills but also highlights my ability to derive meaningful insights from data, making it a valuable addition to my data analyst portfolio.
